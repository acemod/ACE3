# Overview

## Jumping
Adds the ability to jump when pressing the vault key while moving. (V - key)

## Minor animation tweaks
Walking slowly with the weapon lowered now has a less silly looking animation.

## Fatigue adjustments
Soldiers get fatigued slower, but regain their stamina slower aswell. Fatigued soldiers have a faster walking speed and no longer turn into snails.

## Weight display
Adds a weight of the current loadout display in the inventory to estimate the fatigue gain while moving in combat. Can be adjusted to display lb. instead of kg in the ACE Options Menu.

## Optics view in all stances
The player can now use the sights of rifles and pistols in all prone stances.
