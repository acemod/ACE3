## 1. Overview

This adds the ability to use the flash suppressors that are already in game but not accessible.

Flash suppressors are devices that reduce the muzzle flash while firing by cooling or dispersing the burning gases that exit the muzzle. Its intent is to reduce the chances that the shooter will be blinded in low-light shooting conditions as well as reducing the intensity of the flash visible to the enemy.
