**ACE3** is a joint effort by the teams behind **ACE2**, **AGM** and **CSE** to improve the realism and authenticity of Arma 3.

This mod is entirely **open-source**, and everyone is free to propose changes or maintain their own, customized version as long as they make their changes open to the public in accordance with the GNU General Public License (for more information check the license file attached to this project).

The mod is **built modularly** — almost any PBO can be removed, thus a team can maintain its own tailored version of ACE, which excludes a select number of components that they don't like, or which conflict with other add-ons. Components themselves, like e.g. the medical system, also include various customization options, allowing mission designers to tweak the overall experience.

### Features
*   Improved medical system
*   Logistics system including cargo transport and vehicle maintenance
*   Explosives system including different trigger types
*   Captivity system
*   Realistic names for vehicles and weapons
*   Realistic ballistics including wind and humidity
*   Backblast simulation
*   A fire control system for armored vehicles and helicopters
