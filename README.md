**ACE3** is a joint effort by the teams behind **ACE2**, **AGM** and **CSE** to improve the realism and authenticity of Arma 3.

The project is entirely **open-source** and all contributions are welcome. Feel free to maintain your own custom version, so long as the changes you make are open to the public in accordance with the GNU General Public License ([GPLv2](https://github.com/acemod/ACE3/blob/master/LICENSE)).

The mod is **built modularly**, so almost any included PBO can be easily removed from the configuration. This way, a team can maintain its own tailored version of ACE by simply excluding any components they don't need, or those possibly in conflict with other add-ons. Modules themselves, e.g. the medical system, also include various customization options, allowing mission designers to tweak the overall experience.

### Core features
* Brand new 3D interaction/action system
* Performance and reliability framework
* Focus on modularity and customization

* Proper & consistent network-synced weather
* Wind and weather-based ballistics
* Captivity system
* Explosives system, including different trigger types
* Map screen improvements – marker placement and map tools
* Advanced missile guidance and laser designation

#### Additional features
* Carrying and dragging

* A fire control system (FCS) for armored vehicles and helicopters
* Realistic ballistics/FCS calculated in C/C++ extensions
* Backblast area and overpressure simulation
* Disposable launchers

* Realistic night and thermal vision modes
* Magazine repacking
* Realistic weapon overheating mechanic
* Combat deafness (temporary loss of hearing) simulation
