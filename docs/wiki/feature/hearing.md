## 1. Overview

### 1.1 Hearing damage simulation
Introduces hearing damage caused by nearby explosions and large-caliber weapons.

### 1.2 Earplugs
Adds earplugs to mitigate that effect. Soldiers with high caliber weapons or missile launchers will be automatically equipped with those, but remember to put them in.
Their drawback is that they reduce the general hearing volume.

### 1.3 Active hearing protection
Some types of helmets/hats with PELTOR-like earmuffs or 2-ear headsets can mitigate hearing damage without dropping the volume.

### 1.4 Crew hearing protection
Armored vehicle crew and pilot helmets provide the best hearing protection while also dropping general volume, which can be desirable in loud vehicles as most communication happens via intercom or radios.

## 2. Usage

### 2.1 Equipping earplugs
- For this you need the `Earplugs` item.
- Press the self interaction key <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>⊞&nbsp;Win</kbd> (ACE3 default key bind `Self Interaction Key`).
- Select `Equipment`.
- Select `Earplugs in`.
- Same method to remove them but the option is `Earplugs out`.
- Note: you're able to re-use earplugs.
