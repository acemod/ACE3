## 1. Overview

### 1.1 Hearing damage simulation
Introduces hearing damage caused by nearby explosions and large-caliber weapons.

### 1.2 Earplugs
Adds earplugs to mitigate that effect. Soldiers with high caliber weapons or missile launchers will be automatically equipped with those, but remember to put them in.
Their drawback is that they reduce the general hearing volume.

### 1.3 Electronic hearing protection
Some types of helmets/hats with PELTOR-like earmuffs or 2-ear headsets can mitigate hearing damage by dropping the volume only when loid noises occour, without attenuating general hearing volume.
The `Electronic Hearing Protection` item provides the same effect, with usage similar to earplugs.

### 1.4 Crew hearing protection
Armored vehicle crew and pilot helmets provide the best hearing protection while also dropping general volume, which can be desirable in loud vehicles as most communication happens via intercom or radios.
