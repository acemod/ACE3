## 1. Overview

### 1.1 Overpressure
Adds backblast to Man-Portable AT/AA launchers, static/vehicle-mounted Missile launchers and Recoilless Guns.
Tank and Artillery cannons also have large overpressure zones that can cause injury to dismounted personnel.

Don't stand behind a firing RPG or it'll hurt!
