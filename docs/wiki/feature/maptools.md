## 1. Overview

### 1.1 Line drawing
This adds the possibility to draw accurate lines on the map screen.

### 1.2 Map tools
This adds map tools that can be used to measure distances between two points or bearings on the map.

### 1.3 Plotting Board
This adds a plotting board that can be used to aid in the rapid usage and adjustment of short-ranged indirect fires, as well as quick measurements of directions and distances between points, and general land-navigation.

### 1.4 GPS on map
If you have GPS capability, a GPS display will be shown on the map, indicating current grid position. (You don't need the `Map Tools` item in your inventory for this.)

## 2. Usage

### 2.1 Using map tools
- To use map tools the `Map Tools` item is required.
- Open the map <kbd>M</kbd> (Arma 3 default key bind `Map`).
- Press the self interaction key <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>⊞&nbsp;Win</kbd> (ACE3 default key bind `Self Interaction Key`).
- Select `Map tools`.
- Select the type of tools you want to use.
- Note that you can drag the Roamer (map tool) around with <kbd>LMB</kbd> and rotate it with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>LMB</kbd>.

### 2.2 Drawing lines
- To draw lines the `Map Tools` item is required.
- Press <kbd>ALT</kbd> + <kbd>LMB</kbd> to start the line, left click again to end it.
- To delete a line press <kbd>Del</kbd> around the center of the line.
- Note that you can change the color of the lines by clicking on one of the coloured column on top of the screen (While the map is opened).

### 2.3 Using the plotting board
- To use map tools the `Plotting Board` item is required.
- Open the map <kbd>M</kbd> (Arma 3 default key bind `Map`).
- Press the self interaction key <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>⊞&nbsp;Win</kbd> (ACE3 default key bind `Self Interaction Key`).
- Select `Show Plotting Board`.
- Note that you can drag the Plotting Board around with <kbd>LMB</kbd> and rotate the different parts of the Plotting Board, each independently from each other, with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>LMB</kbd>.
- When a new marker (Local or Group Channel) is created on the inner circle of the Plotting board, the marker will move accordingly when the Plotting Board gets moved or rotated.

### 2.4 Drawing lines
- You can draw lines on the plotting board.
- These lines are removed from the map once the plotting board is hidden, but they restored when the plotting board is shown again.
- These lines are moved along with the plotting board when the plotting board is dragged.
