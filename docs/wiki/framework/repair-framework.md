## 1. Config Values

### 1.1 Setting Vehicle As Repair Location

A vehicle will be set as a repair truck based on the config `ace_repair_canRepair`.
Setting `fullRepairLocation` needs to be enabled and is by *disabled* default.

```cpp
class CfgVehicles {
    class Car_F;
    class MyTruck: Car_F {
        ace_repair_canRepair = 1; // Make repair vehicle
    };
};
```

### 1.2 Setting Vehicle Spare Wheels and Tracks

A vehicle can have a default count of spare wheels/tracks based on the config `ace_repair_spareWheels` and `ace_repair_spareTracks`.
Values set in 3den for a vehicle will be used first. Vehicles with no value set in 3den or config will default to 1 spare wheel/track.

```cpp
class CfgVehicles {
    class Car_F;
    class MyTruck: Car_F {
        ace_repair_spareWheels = 4;
    };
    class Tank_F;
    class MyTank: Tank_F {
        ace_repair_spareTracks = 4;
    };
};
```

## 2. Variables

## 2.1 Make A Vehicle Into A Repair Truck

A vehicle can be turned into a repair truck by setting the variable `ACE_isRepairVehicle` to `1` to enable, `0` to disable.
- Setting `fullRepairLocation` needs to be enabled and is by *disabled* default.
- Can be set via 3den attribute.

```cpp
VEHICLE setVariable ["ACE_isRepairVehicle", 1, true];
```

## 2.2 Make An Object Into A Repair Facility

An object can be turned into a repair facility by setting the variable `ace_isRepairFacility` to `1` to enable, `0` to disable.
- Setting `fullRepairLocation` needs to be enabled and is by *disabled* default.
- Can be set via 3den attribute.
- Object cannot be a vehicle.

```cpp
OBJECT setVariable ["ace_isRepairFacility", 1, true];
```

## 2.3 Set Engineer Trait Level On Unit

Determines if a unit can repair damaged hitpoints and if so, how much can be restored. See ACE - Logistics settings for more details.
- Can easily be set via 3den attribute.

To set a units engineer trait level set the variable `ace_isEngineer` to:
- `0` / false: Untrained, only be able to replace wheels, based on settings.
- `1` / true: Engineer.
- `2` : Advanced Engineer, allowing a higher level of repairs, based on settings. (by default settings is the only one with access to full repair)

```cpp
UNIT setVariable ["ace_isEngineer", 1, true];
```

## 2.3 Blacklist a Vehicle for Repairs
Prevents a vehicle from being repaired by players by setting the `ace_repair_disabled` variable to `true`.
```sqf
// vehicles Init field in the 
this setVariable ["ace_repair_disabled", true];

// exeucted by a serverside script during a cutscene
_truck setVariable ["ace_repair_disabled", true, true];
```
