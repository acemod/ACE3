## 1. Config Values

### 1.1 Launchers

```cpp
class CfgWeapons {
    class MyLauncher {
        ace_overpressure_angle = 60;    // Cone in which the damage is applied (in degrees from the back end of the launcher)
        ace_overpressure_range = 15;    // Range in meters in which the damage is applied
        ace_overpressure_damage = 0.7;  // Damage multiplier
        ace_overpressure_offset = 1;    // Offset from the projectile, where the backblast originates
    };
};
```

### 1.2 Cannons

```cpp
class CfgWeapons {
    class MyBananaCannon {
        ace_overpressure_angle = 90;    // Cone in which the damage is applied (in degrees from the muzzle of the cannon)
        ace_overpressure_range = 50;    // Range in meters in which the damage is applied
        ace_overpressure_damage = 0.85; // Damage multiplier
    };
};
```

- You can note that the angle range and damage values are higher, that's because this is a cannon and the backblast area is bigger.
