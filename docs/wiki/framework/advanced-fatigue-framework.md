## 1. Global Settings

ACE provides multiple settings to tweak Advanced Fatigue. Adjust these settings depending on how hard you want your experience to be.

- **Enabled:** This allow you to toggle Advanced Fatigue on or off. Mission needs to be restarted if this setting is changed.
- **Show stamina bar:** Shows/hides the stamina bar.
- **Fade Stamina bar automatically:** Adjusts transparency of the bar based on stamina status.
- **Performance factor:** This influences the overall performance of players, malnourished or super soldiers, everything is possible.
- **Recovery factor:** Do you like looking at the landscape or think breaks are boring? Whatever the case, this influences the length of your stamina breaks.
- **Load factor:** If you believe a Javelin is the perfect companion for your .50 BMG sniper rifle you probably should tweak this setting.
- **Terrain factor:** Not everyone is used to mountainous terrain. Tweak this until you feel more at home.
- **Sway factor:** Influences the amount of weapon sway. Higher means more sway.
- **Rested sway factor:** Influences the amount of weapon sway while rested is deployed. Higher means more sway.
- **Deployed sway factor:** Influences the amount of weapon sway while weapon is deployed. Higher means more sway.

## 2. Unit Specific Settings

When double clicking a unit you can find a performance factor slider under the ACE options. This unit specific factor will override the global setting, but is only applied to that unit, unless you select multiple and change the slider for all of them at once of course.
