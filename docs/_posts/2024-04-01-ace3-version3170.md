This post accompanies the release of ACE3 v3.17.0, a smaller but not any less significant release. We will also take a peek at at our new experimental project.

### Release Cadence

With improved tooling such as [HEMTT](https://github.com/BrettMayson/HEMTT) simplifying our release processes, we have been aiming aiming to do releases more often than in the past. This is one of the first bigger releases following the set cadence.

While releases are expected to be smaller as less time passes between them resulting in fewer changes, the new cadence should effectively contribute to higher quality and stability of ACE3 overall.

We are maintaining our philosophy of "no schedule, no ETAs" and simply release when the team is able to and opts to do so. Work done on the project should not affect this and we aim to release more often even if there are only little or insignificant changes.

### Integrated CUP Compatibility

[Community Upgrade Project](https://www.cup-arma3.org/) has always provided compatibility and support for ACE3. Originally it has been hosted and maintained by the CUP Team. With the availability of automatically loading a compatibility patch if the given mod is loaded, we have worked together with the CUP Team to bring ACE3 Compatibility for CUP directly into the ACE3 mod.

**This means you should remove any compatibility patches provided by CUP** and instead simply use ACE3 together with CUP. In addition to integrated compatibility, some additional improvements were also made.

### ACE Anvil

[ACE Anvil](https://github.com/acemod/ACE-Anvil) is an **experimental** realism mod for Arma Reforger, the first Arma game running on the Enfusion engine.

Anvil is not expected to reach feature parity with ACE3. It is heavily experimental and we invite you to contribute to it. As Arma Reforger is a test platform, go wild, we are happy to add any realism or quality of life features, even some that might not be strictly within ACE's usual scope.

Learn more about ACE Anvil at the [Anvil Documentation](https://anvil.acemod.org/)!

### The End Things

We are still in need for translations for some languages within the ACE3 project. Please have a look at [this GitHub issue to track the progress and what languages lack translations](https://github.com/acemod/ACE3/issues/367){:target="_blank"}. Any and all help with this is very appreciated.
